##Abstract (our paper)

Web-based social and communication technologies enable citizens to self-organize relief efforts in response to crises. This work focuses on a question fundamental to the concept of collective intelligence: how effective are such self-organized channels, ungoverned by any central authority, in conforming to their intended function? In this study we examine the hashtag #PorteOuverte ("#OpenDoor") introduced during the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks, as an "improvised logistical channel" (ILC) to help individuals to find a safe shelter near the attack sites. We analyze the dynamics and effectiveness of #PorteOuverte by comparing its proportion of relevant logistical messages -- individuals requesting or offering shelter -- to other messages such as those offering emotional consolation or commenting on the hashtag itself.  Our results reveal that the vast majority of messages are not relevant, however the crowd senses and spreads relevant messages more than others.  We further demonstrate that relevant messages can be automatically detected and thus algorithmic promotion may be possible.
